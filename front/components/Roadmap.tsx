            <p>5 ETH Giveaway - 1 ETH for 5 Rolling Dino holders each.</p>
            <p>
              Introducing the $ROLL token which can be obtained by staking a
              Rolling Dino NFT, which opens a lot of new opportunities. This
              time extinct Dinos will revive in the metaverse, but they don’t
              come alone, they come with your very own Rolling Object!
            </p>
            <p>
              Holders will be able to mint 3d VX versions of their own Rolling
              Object along with a new VX Dino version using the $ROLL token! The
              Rolling Object that you will be able to mint will rely on your
              Rolling object. This means the rarer your NFT the rarer the VX
              version! They will be playable in the metaverse giving lots of new
              possibilities such as special community events along with PvP
              which enables a play-to-earn mechanism and much more!

              Dinos are extinct, but we want to save other endangered species—$
              10.000 donation to endangered animals & protecting rainforests.
              Per minted Dino; we will in addition plant 1 tree to help save our
              environment.

              Activation of unique utilities. Our goal is to maximize the amount
              of utility possible. Every Rolling Object comes with a unique
              utility from which every Dino holder can benefit - regardless of
              the rarity. EVERY rolling object comes with a unique utility.
              Rolling traits will decide for which exclusive benefit you’ll
              qualify. Our benefits are connecting the NFT world with the real
              world – and getting the best of both worlds.
            </p>
            <p>
              Among holders, benefits like flight vouchers, custom skate deck, a
              quad, a jetski, and a Cabrio leasing will be distributed depending
              on your personal rolling object.
            </p>
            <p>
              In particular, that means: Rolling Object Quad trait will qualify
              for winning a quad, Cargo Plane trait owner will receive a
              guaranteed flight voucher. With rising rarity, benefits get more
              exclusive.
            </p>
            <p>
              There will also be 7 unique 1:1 Rolling Dinos NFT’s. Those will
              have even crazier benefits – we will keep it a surprise but expect
              something huge.
            </p>
            <p>
              On top of that, we want to celebrate our sellout with a wild
              afterparty: For 7-days straight we are giving away prizes worth
              between $1,000 - $2,000 a day to Rolling Dino holders.
            </p>
            <p>The unique assets will be distributed in Q1 2022. Stay tuned!</p>
